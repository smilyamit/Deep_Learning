There's one additional rule of thumb that helps for supervised learning problems. The upper bound on the number of 
hidden neurons that won't result in over-fitting is:

Nh=Ns/(a*(Ni+No))

Ni = number of input neurons.
No = number of output neurons.
Ns = number of samples in training data set.
a = an arbitrary scaling factor usually 2-10.
