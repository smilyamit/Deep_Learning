For the first example NN1, the MSEdog = 1/3 * [(1-0.9)^2 + (0-0.1)^2 + (1-0.4)^2] and MSEcat = 1/3 * [(0-0.1)^2 +
 (1-0.9)^2 + (0-0.6)^2]. The term 1/3 is actually 1/n, where n = no of observations/generated predictions.

The total MSE = MSEdog + MSEcat ~0.25. In a similar way, we calculate the MSE for NN2 ~0.71.
